## ⚡ ZAP Rebuttals

- **Pain And Suffering**: Adjuster refused to disclose the pain & suffering valuation breakdown. This blocks meaningful negotiation and may constitute a failure of good faith.
- **Future Medicals**: No IME was conducted. Denial or reduction of future medicals without a counter-medical opinion lacks medical authority.
- **Medical Specials Total**: Medical specials were accepted without IME. Adjuster may not later dispute these values.
- **Lost Wages**: Lost wages were reduced despite documentation. Employer opinion does not override physician work capacity statements.
- **Mileage**: Mileage was reduced. Claimant's treatment location and frequency were disclosed and verifiable.
